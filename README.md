# 🌐 Personal Web Portfolio

This is my first web development project, built as part of the **Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** by [Angela Yu on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

It’s a **static portfolio website** created using:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## ✨ Features

- Clean, responsive layout
- Simple and modern design
- Personal profile section
- Skills section
- Links to social media

## 🚀 Deployment

To challenge myself, I deployed the site using **Amazon Web Services**:

- **S3** for hosting the static files
- **CloudFront** for global content distribution
